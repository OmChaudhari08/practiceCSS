            <SPAN>Miyamoto Musashi</SPAN> (born 1584, Mimasaka or Harima, Japan—died June 13, 1645, Higo) was a famous
            Japanese soldier-artist of the early Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603–1867).

            Musashi began his career as a fighter early in life when, at age 13, he killed a man in single combat. In
            1600 he was on the losing side of the Battle of Sekigahara (which paved the way for establishing the
            Tokugawa shogunate), becoming one of the rōnin (masterless samurai). In time he set out on a personal quest
            to develop perfect sword technique. He invented the nitō ichi-ryū, the style of fencing with two swords, and
            is often referred to today as kensai (‘‘sword saint’’). Musashi claimed to have fought in more than 60
            individual sword fights, many of which were to the death and all of which he won.
            <br>
            Musashi’s most famous encounter took place in 1612, against his arch rival Sasaki Kojirō, a swordsman whose
            skill was reported to be equal to his own. The contest took place on a small island off the coast of Japan.
            While being rowed out to the dueling site, Musashi fashioned a wooden sword out of an oar. When the two
            enemies finally met on the beach, Musashi quickly dispatched Kojirō with a well-placed blow to the head
            using his wooden sword. After that, feeling that he had reached his peak as a swordsman, Musashi retired
            from the dueling life, though he trained some students and helped to suppress the Shimabara Rebellion in
            1637.
